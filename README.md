# FlatPress example site

## Introduction

[FlatPress](https://github.com/diegolagoglez/flatpress) is a really simple CMS with no database nor any dynamic language.

This is a example site repository to publish with it.

All entries are from my old and disapeared blog.

## Deploy

First of all, deploy FlatPress.

Second, go to `&lt;my-flatpress-deployment-dir&gt;/site` and deploy this site with:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/diegolagoglez/flatpress-example-site
```

Finally, run `make` to build the site and access it with your favourite browser.

Oh, do not forget to configure your web server.
